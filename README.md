The PyCitySchools repository contains custom python scripts using the Pandas library and Jupyter Notebooks to analyze fictional district-wide standardized test results.

##The final PyCitySchools report includes the following information:

##District Summary
A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate

##School Summary
An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate 

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Included are:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate

## Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.

## Math Scores by Grade

A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Reading Score by Grade 

A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
## Scores by School Spending

Tables that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student) using 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Each table includes the following:
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

## Scores by School Size
Similar to the "Scores by School Spending" table, but in this table the schools are grouped based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

## Scores by School Type
Similar to the "Scores by School Size" table, but in this table, schools are grouped based on school type (Charter vs. District).
